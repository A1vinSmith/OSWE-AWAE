There are some differences here. With a password, once I find that the 4th character is “P”, there’s no need to try other characters. That’s not the case with usernames, as “administrator”, “admin”, and “adam” could all be users. 

To solve this, I’ll use recursion. The function takes the valid start of a username as the input and tries that input plus each character. For all that succeed, it calls the same function, passing in the start + the new character. If none of the characters succeed, that means that the passed in string must be the username.
